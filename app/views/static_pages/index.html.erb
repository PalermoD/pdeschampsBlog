	<h1>About</h1>
	
	<p class="about_text">
		 On my off time I am usually at a tech meetup, or building out an idea in the latest and most popular technologies, at the moment that's react. I have an obsession with learning new things and solving tough problems. An example of my dedication was when I worked at sequel media and was tasked to rebuild the entire platform in a stack I never worked in, and was able to do so in a few months handling the devops, backend, database, and front-end improving performance and cutting down server costs from $5000 to $200. 
	</p>
	<p class="about_text">
		I am up to date on best practices and terms and Iâ€™m fast and efficient. I am incredibly organized and very detail oriented; I rarely make errors and know what even a small mistake can mean to a project. I am also a thorough communicator and work well as part of a team in addition to my ability for self-direction.
	</p>
	<p class="about_text">
		I've studied marketing, art, design, and can work comfortably throughout most stacks or learn them quickly. I have built my own startups in the past and understand business logic as it relates to what we are building and why. In short I'm a software engineer with a passion for building awesome and beautiful things.
